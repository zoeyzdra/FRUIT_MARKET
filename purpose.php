    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>  This company was created two years ago, when our founder Mary Maryson decided she wanted to grow her own food when she discovered the wonders of modern farming. Hydroponics alongside OTHER STUFF. Thus began her journey to where we are now at Berry Bay.</p>
    <br>
<p>   Mary always had a love of gardening. Growing her own food and watching as it grew. One day while researching better ways to water her plants she stumbled across hydroponics. Growing plants without dirt, but instead a steady stream with all the nutrients the plants needed. Diving headfirst, Mary soon gathered everything she would need, and with the help of Jason Maryson, her brother, she built her first system.</p>
    <br>
<p>   It was a failure.</p>
    <br>
<p>  Undeterred she kept working until her yield was bountiful. Witch to put milady was far too much for her alone, or even her friends or family. That is when a close friend of hers mentioned she could sell her extra at a farmerâ€™s market in the next town over.She began making the drive almost every other week to sell her own produce and see what others had to offer.</p>
    <br>
 <p>   She quickly noticed how few people were coming despite people she talked to showing interest. And how quickly things sold out for the entire season. She looked at her own produce and got an idea. One loan and lots of paperwork later Mary was the owner of her own business.</p>
