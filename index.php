         <p>Our fruit is some of the best around! All ground in-house our produce is always fresh no matter the time of year. This is all thanks to our amazing water irrigation system that grows all of our fruits! Using this system we can give each plant exactly what they need and get the perfect plant every time.

<p>We grow each and every fruit we sell! From the strawberries to our pears,  they are all given exactly what they need to be the best plant they could be! So, when you order you get it fresh from the plant, not something shipped from across the nation! This leaves you with more nutrition than what you get at the local supermarket.

<p>Cut or pick straight from the plant, we Garnette you get the fruit within 48 hours! Our Fruit is the freshest fruit to ever be grown!</p>
